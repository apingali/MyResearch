    "\n",
    "Small Language Models (SLMs) are compact neural networks designed for natural language processing tasks that prioritize efficiency and practicality over raw performance. Unlike their larger counterparts (such as GPT-4 or Claude), SLMs are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Typically under 10 billion parameters\n",
    "2. Capable of running on consumer hardware\n",
    "3. Often optimized for specific use cases\n",
    "4. More interpretable and controllable\n",
    "5. Easier to fine-tune and modify\n"

    "## Why Small Language Models Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Small language models are becoming increasingly important for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resource Efficiency**: They require less computational power and memory\n",
    "- **Privacy**: Can run locally without sending data to external servers\n",
    "- **Latency**: Generally provide faster response times\n",
    "- **Cost**: Lower operational costs for deployment\n",
