# Small Language Models: An Overview

> An exploration of compact, efficient language models

## What is a Small Language Model?

Small Language Models (SLMs) are compact neural networks designed for
natural language processing tasks that prioritize efficiency and
practicality over raw performance. Unlike their larger counterparts
(such as GPT-4 or Claude), SLMs are:

1.  Typically under 10 billion parameters
2.  Capable of running on consumer hardware
3.  Often optimized for specific use cases
4.  More interpretable and controllable
5.  Easier to fine-tune and modify

## Why Small Language Models Matter

Small language models are becoming increasingly important for several
reasons:

- **Resource Efficiency**: They require less computational power and
  memory
- **Privacy**: Can run locally without sending data to external servers
- **Latency**: Generally provide faster response times
- **Cost**: Lower operational costs for deployment
- **Customization**: Easier to specialize for specific domains or tasks
